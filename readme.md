    This project utilized SQL for the database, along with C# and ASP.NET. Its objective is to develop a web portal catering to bachelor students, offering various user roles such as Students, Lecturers, External Examiners, Coordinators, admins, and others (around 15 user options). The aim is to streamline the process of students' bachelor journey, including topic selection, defense grading, meeting scheduling with instructors, managing external industrial projects with companies and their employees, and enabling examiners to create different project types for students.
